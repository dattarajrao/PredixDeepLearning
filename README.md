# Demo of running TensorFlow model on Predix

by Dattaraj J Rao - Principal Architect - GE Transportation - <a href='mailto:Dattaraj.Rao@ge.com'>Dattaraj.Rao@ge.com</a>

This code will be shown as part of the webinar: https://www.techgig.com/webinar/Deep-Learning-on-Predix-for-Image-Recognition-1163

This webinar will give an overview of Deep Learning technique and its applications - including a real-world usecase from railway domain. We will cover basics of Deep learning models and frameworks for developing these models. We will talk about the model development and deployment process and role of Data Scientist vs Developer.
There will also be a brief code walk-through of running a TensorFlow model for analyzing images and developing a Predix application to do the same. We will walk through a real Predix application that can recognize objects in any image from the Internet and label them. Finally we talk about some of the latest trends on Deep Learning and show how GE Transportation is leveraging this Technology for a real-world usecase.
